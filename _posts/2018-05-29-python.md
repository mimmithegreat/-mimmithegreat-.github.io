# Python code

here is the code for the last homework.
Note: This code was written more or less because of group work. There were several people in the course involved, including
a friend of mine who is not taking the course for digital humanities. He was the one who suggested to include the part with the absolute
path.
In Addition to that, I included the code pieces which are described at the course homepage.


import os
import sys
import re


#define absolute path
srcPath = os.path.abspath('files_xml')
outPath = os.path.abspath('outOrdner')

#abort if absolute path does not exist
if not os.path.exists(srcPath):
    print("Source path not found!")
    sys.exit()

#create output path if not existing
if not os.path.exists(outPath):
    os.mkdir(outPath, 0o755)

#read all file names into array
fileNames = [f for f in os.listdir(srcPath) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(srcPath, f))]

#strip content from xml
def xmlStrip(xml_str):
    regex = re.compile("<[^<]+>")
    return regex.sub("", xml_str)

#main loop for manipulating content
for fileName in fileNames:
    #open input and output files
    f_in = open(os.path.join(srcPath, fileName), 'r', encoding="utf8")
    f_out = open(os.path.join(outPath, fileName + "_modified.xml"), 'w', encoding="utf8")
    #read content from input file
    content = f_in.read()
    #call xml_strip function
    output = xmlStrip(content)
    #write content into output file = xml
    f_out.write(output)
    #close files
    f_in.close()
    f_out.close()
