# Describing the process

So I took tried to take not to much from the code that was available at the course site. But that didn´t work out. I also tried to use a
list instead of a dictionary at the beginning, at the recomendation from Erika. This also failed so I stook to the dictionary.
At one point I was able to form all three csv files. But all of them were faulty. So I had to go back to the code. After several days of rewriting
it, finally have to conclude that it just won´t work. However I can not identify the problem. In addition, I also tried with the code, which
was on the course site (which is almost identical) and it also failed with basiclly the same errors.
I also tried to write everything into one file and compile it, but after a certain length my RAM said no. So I split them up into 3 files of code
again. But it complicated certain issues. In the end, I couldn´t proceed to the qgis part ot this homework. I didn´t describe every single line
in the second file, since I described a lot already in the first one.
