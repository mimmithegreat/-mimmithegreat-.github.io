# Social Network Analysis


## Post Comentary
I had extensive cooperation with Erika on the homeworks Social Network Analysis and Mapping the Text. With this homework the lion share came
from Erika who in turn told me that she had additional help with it. I tried to help her in turn out with Mapping the Text. But, because
I am not as good as she, I coulnÂ´t deliver the finished working code.
