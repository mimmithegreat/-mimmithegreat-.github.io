# Topic Modelling

So I tried to run the code multiple times. The packages were installed. I did all the changes required and even made sure that both Java and R were both 86.
However it wouln´t work. I also tried to run the code of others, for example from Lukas. Unfortunatly this didn´t change anything.
I just would not create the diagrams as required. I uninstalled both several times. I googled the errors. 

I just couldn´t figure out, where the problem lies.
