When intellig-ence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate--everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments. I.},

	title = {Thought {Experiments}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entrieshought-experiment/},
	abstract = {Thought experiments are devices of the imagination used to investigatethe nature of things. They are used for diverse reasons in a varietyof areas, including economics, history, mathematics, philosophy, andthe sciences, especially physics. Most often thought experiments arecommunicated in narrative form, frequently with diagrams. Thoughtexperiments should be distinguished from thinking about experiments,from merely imagining any experiments to be conducted outside theimagination, and from psychological experiments with thoughts. Theyshould also be distinguished from counterfactual reasoning in general,as they seem to require an experimental element, which seems toexplain the impression that something is experienced in a thoughtexperiment. In other words, though many call any counter-factual orhypothetical situation a thought experiment, this seems tooencompassing.  It seems right to demand that they also be visualized(or perhaps smelled, tasted, heard, touched); there should besomething experimental about a thought experiment. , The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple:How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?More precisely, are there thought experiments that enable us toacquire new knowledge about the intended realm of investigationwithout new empirical data? If so, where does the new information come from ifnot from contact with the realm of investigation underconsideration? Finally, how can we distinguish good from bad instancesof thought experiments? These questions seem urgent with respectto scientific thought experiments, because most philosophers andhistorians of science “recognize them as an occasionally potenttool for increasing our understanding of nature. […]Historically their role is very close to the double one played byactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thoughtexperiments can disclose nature's failure to conform to a previouslyheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particularways in which both expectation and theory must henceforth berevised.” (Kuhn, 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions are urgentregarding philosophical thought experiments, because they play animportant role in philosophical discourse. Philosophy without thoughtexperiments seems almost hopeless.,  There is widespread agreement that thought experiments play acentral role both in philosophy and in the natural sciences. Generalacceptance of the importance of some of the well-known thoughtexperiments in the natural sciences, like Maxwell's demon, Einstein'selevator or Schrödinger's cat. Probably more often than not,these, and many other thought experiments have led the carefulanalysis of their epistemic powers to the conclusion that we shouldnot portray science as an exclusively empirical activity (seeWinchester, 1990, p. 79).,  The 17th century saw some of its most brilliant practitioners inGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz. And in our own time, thecreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkablewithout the crucial role played by thought experiments. Much ofethics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind is based on theresults of thought experiments as well, including Searle's Chineseroom, Putnam's twin earth, and Jackson's Mary the colourscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severelyimpoverished without thought experiments, which suggests that aunified theory of thought experiments is desirable to account for themin both the sciences and the humanities (see Boniolo, 1997; Cooper,2005, pp. 329–330; Gähde, 2000). That is to say: since thesciences, especially physics, and philosophy both make use of thoughtexperiments, then, other things being equal, a unified account seemsdesirable.,  There have been attempts to define “thoughtexperiment”, but likely it will be better to leave the termloosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the ongoinginvestigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what thoughtexperiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (seeHaggqvist, 2009), but this does not mean we need to begin with atechnical definition, specifying necessary and sufficientconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal withremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to referto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well asthose already mentioned, there are Newton's bucket, Heisenberg'sgamma-ray microscope, Einstein's elevator, Leibniz's mill, Parfit'speople who split like amoebas, and Thomson's violinist. Everyone isprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thoughtexperiments include “the dome”, a relatively new thoughtexperiment and probably the simplest example of indeterminism inNewtonian physics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetricsurface in a gravitational field. Guided by Newton's laws of motionone comes to realize that the mass can either remain at rest for alltimes, or spontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton,2008). This thought experiment triggers a number of very interestingquestions concerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,of course, does it show what it claims? , In the following we will first highlight some of the most commonfeatures of thought experiments. A proposal follows for classifyingthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate onthought experimenting, preceded by some remarks about the history ofphilosophical inquiry into thought experiments. We conclude byhighlighting some of the recent developments surrounding the so-calledlaboratory of the mind.},

This open access volume contains a selection of resulting papers, some previously unpublished, some published but not readily accessible [from past meetings of The International Union for the Scientific Study of Population and its research committees, or from other small conferences and seminars]. Rejecting the idea that demography is simply a branch of applied statistics, his work views it as an autonomous and complete scientific discipline. When viewed from the perspective of modern philosophy of science, specifically the semantic or model-based school, demography is a balanced discipline, with a rich body of techniques and data, but also with more and better theories than generally recognized. As demonstrated in this book, some demographic techniques can also be seen as theoretical models, and some substantive/behavioral models, commonly rejected as theory because of inconsistent observations, are now seen as valuable theoretical models, for example demographic transition theory. This book shows how demography can build a strong theoretical edifice on its broad and deep empirical foundation by adoption of the model-based approach to science. But the full-fruits of this approach will require demographers to make greater use of computer modeling [both macro- and micro-simulation], in the statement and manipulation of theoretical ideas, as well as for numerical computation.

If we attend closely to the manner in which theoretical laws figure in the practice of science, we see that despite their great explanatory power these laws do not describe reality. Instead, fundamental laws describe highly idealized objects in models. Thus, the correct account of explanation in science is not the traditional covering law view, but the ‘simulacrum’ account. On this view, explanation is a matter of constructing a model that may employ, but need not be consistent with, a theoretical framework, in which phenomenological laws that are true of the empirical case in question can be derived. Anti‐realism about theoretical laws does not, however, commit one to anti‐realism about theoretical entities. Belief in theoretical entities can be grounded in well‐tested localized causal claims about concrete physical processes, sometimes now called ‘entity realism’. Such causal claims provide the basis for partial realism and they are ineliminable from the practice of explanation and intervention in nature.},

	abstract = {With elegance and candor, Greg Dening offers a panoramic collection of rich and densely textured essays that demonstrate how we can only understand our present through our consciousness of the past and how in thinking about the past we mirror the time and place of our own living.For Dening, history saturates every moment of our cultural and personal existence. Yet he is keenly aware that the actual past remains fundamentally irreplicable. All histories are culturally crafted artifacts, commensurate with folk tales, stage plays, or films. Whether derived from logbooks and letters, or displayed on music hall stages and Hollywood back lots, history is in essence our making sense of what has and continues to happen, creating for us a sense of our cultural and individual selves.Through juxtapositions of actual events and creative reenactments of them—such as the mutiny on the Bounty in 1787 and the various Hollywood films that depict that event—Dening calls attention to the provocative moment of theatricality in history making where histories, cultures, and selves converge. Moving adeptly across varied terrains, from the frontiers of North America to the islands of the South Pacific, Dening marshals a striking array of diverse, often recalcitrant, sources to examine the tangled histories of cross-cultural clash and engagement. Refusing to portray conquest, colonization, and hegemony simply as abstract processes, Dening, in his own culturally reflexive performance, painstakingly evokes the flesh and form of past actors, both celebrated and unsung, whose foregone lives have become our history.},

Both presuppose the existence of conceptualizations as ways of conceiving the world “in certain delimited ways.” But high-level programming languages also function as models of virtual (or abstract) machines, while low-level programming languages function as models of causal (or physical) machines. The resulting account suggests that sets of models embedded within models are indispensable for computer programming.},

	abstract = {Physics, and natural science in general, is a reasonable enterprisebased on valid experimental evidence, criticism, and rationaldiscussion. It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and itis experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles isto test theories and to provide the basis for scientific knowledge.[1] It can also call for a new theory, either byshowing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a newphenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hintstoward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it canprovide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in ourtheories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent oftheory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looksinteresting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theoryto explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presentedbelow.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several ofthese roles at once., If experiment is to play these important roles in science then wemust have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science isa fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.Science is more complex than “The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.”It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theoriesoften need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clearhow Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cutresults, and may even disagree for a time., In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimentalresults. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on theseexperimental results.},

I first distinguish between “static” models (like a map) and “dynamic” models endowed with the capacity to generate processes. Only the latter can be used to simulate. I then criticize the view according to which the difference between models/simulations and experiments is fundamentally epistemic in character. Following Herbert Simon, I argue that the difference is ontological. Simulations merely require the existence of an abstract correspondence between the simulating and the simulated system. In experiments, in contrast, the causal relations governing the experimental and the target systems are grounded in the same material. Simulations can produce new knowledge just as experiments do, but the prior knowledge needed to run a good simulation is not the same as that needed to run a good experiment. I conclude by discussing “hybrid” cases of “experimental simulations” or “simulating experiments”.},

'Representing' deals with the different philosophical accounts of scientific objectivity and the reality of scientific entities. The views of Kuhn, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Putnam, van Fraassen, and others, are all considered. 'Intervening' presents the first sustained treatment of experimental science for many years and uses it to give a new direction to debates about realism. Hacking illustrates how experimentation often has a life independent of theory. He argues that although the philosophical problems of scientific realism can not be resolved when put in terms of theory alone, a sound philosophy of experiment provides compelling grounds for a realistic attitude. A great many scientific examples are described in both parts of the book, which also includes lucid expositions of recent high energy physics and a remarkable chapter on the microscope in cell biology.},

Three of the central models in contemporary research programs are the Attention-Spotlight metaphor, the Attention As Limited Resource metaphor, and the Biased-Competition metaphor. Each of these metaphoric models involves a specific ontology of entities and processes, and each one entails a specific set of values that guide research on attention. These values are largely incompatible across the three different models. I argue that metaphor-based value systems are characteristic of all science and that this is not a lamentable problem, but rather the source of the insight and experimental fruitfulness of scientific models.},

	abstract = {The psychologist William James observed that "a native talent for perceiving analogies is... the leading fact in genius of every order." The centrality and the ubiquity of analogy in creative thought have been noted again and again by scientists, artists, and writers, and understanding and modeling analogical thought have emerged as two of the most important challenges for cognitive science.Analogy-Making as Perception is based on the premise that analogy-making is fundamentally a high-level perceptual process in which the interaction of perception and concepts gives rise to "conceptual slippages" which allow analogies to be made. It describes Copycat - a computer model of analogymaking, developed by the author with Douglas Hofstadter, that models the complex, subconscious interaction between perception and concepts that underlies the creation of analogies.In Copycat, both concepts and high-level perception are emergent phenomena, arising from large numbers of low-level, parallel, non-deterministic activities. In the spectrum of cognitive modeling approaches, Copycat occupies a unique intermediate position between symbolic systems and connectionist systems a position that is at present the most useful one for understanding the fluidity of concepts and high-level perception.On one level the work described here is about analogy-making, but on another level it is about cognition in general. It explores such issues as the nature of concepts and perception and the emergence of highly flexible concepts from a lower-level "subcognitive" substrate.Melanie Mitchell, Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, is a Fellow of the Michigan Society of Fellows. She is also Director of the Adaptive Computation Program at the Santa Fe Institute.},

	abstract = {Originally published to wide acclaim, this lively, cleverly illustrated essay on the use and abuse of maps teaches us how to evaluate maps critically and promotes a healthy skepticism about these easy-to-manipulate models of reality. Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij.

I outline the characteristic steps of such model experiments or “experiments on models”, and apply the notions to a diagrammatic model in everyday use in economics. I compare these model experiments with two other kinds of experiments (using examples from the same economic domain): laboratory experiments and a hybrid form. This hybrid form involves simulations or “experiments with models”. The paper concludes with a comparison of the role that models play in each case.},

	abstract = {Summary There have been many images of experiment. The contemplative narratives of Aristotle served to illustrate hypotheses and arguments. There was no expectation that they be performed. Even in Galileo's dialogues, the distinction between real experiments and imaginary ones is not sharp (see galileo). During the seventeenth century, performance and public description became essential to the probative power of experiment. These made its methods and procedures transparent, allowing any reader of the narrative to be a virtual witness of an active demonstration (Shapin and Schaffer 1985, pp. 22?79). Thus, by the end of the scientific revolution, illustrative narratives were distinguished from public accounts of experiment as the disciplined, systematic study of phenomena. Eventually this made the efficacy of thought experiments problematic (see Kuhn 1977, pp. 241?2, and thought experiments). As a source of experience of realms previously beyond the reach of the senses, real?world experiment contributed to the rise of objective scientific knowledge. Harvey, Galileo, Hooks, Boyle, Newton, and other proponents of experimental natural philosophy established an important new mode of argumentation.},

It shows readers how they can use theory to interpret historical evidence for themselves, as well as to evaluate the work of others."

	abstract = {This paper attempts to explain why people become confused by questions about the relation between menal and physical events. When a question leads to confused, inconsistent answers, this may be (1) because the question is ultimately meaningless or at least unanswerable, but it may also be (2) because an adequate answer requires a powerful analytical apparatus. My view is that many important questions about relation between mind and brain are of this latter kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on he problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. In this paper we suggest a theory of why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. The paper does not go very far toward finding technical solutions to the questions, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},
